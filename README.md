# Suno Bulk Downloader

A simple command-line Python script to bulk download all of your private songs from [Suno AI](https://suno.com/).

This tool iterates through your library pages, downloads each song, and can optionally embed the cover art directly into the MP3 file's metadata.


## Features

- **Bulk Download:** Downloads all songs from your private library.
- **Metadata Embedding:** Automatically embeds the title, artist, and cover art (thumbnail) into the MP3 file.
- **File Sanitization:** Cleans up song titles to create valid filenames for any operating system.
- **Duplicate Handling:** If a file with the same name already exists, it saves the new file with a version suffix (e.g., `My Song v2.mp3`) to avoid overwriting.
- **Proxy Support:** Allows routing traffic through an HTTP/S proxy.
- **User-Friendly Output:** Uses colored console output for clear and readable progress updates.

## Requirements

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `pip` (Python's package installer, usually comes with Python)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    *(Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.)*

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

The script requires a **Suno Authorization Token** to access your private library. Hereâ€™s how to find it:

### Step 1: Find Your Authorization Token

1.  Open your web browser and go to [suno.com](https://suno.com/) and log in.
2.  Open your browser's **Developer Tools**. You can usually do this by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac).
3.  Go to the **Network** tab in the Developer Tools.
4.  In the filter box, type `feed` to easily find the right request.
5.  Refresh the Suno page or click around your library. You should see a new request appear in the list.
6.  Click on that request (it might be named something like `v2?hide_disliked=...`).
7.  In the new panel that appears, go to the **Headers** tab.
8.  Scroll down to the **Request Headers** section.
9.  Find the `Authorization` header. The value will look like `Bearer [long_string_of_characters]`.
10. **Copy only the long string of characters** (the token itself), *without* the word `Bearer `.



**Important:** Your token is like a password. **Do not share it with anyone.**

### Step 2: Run the Script

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the script's directory, and run it using the following command structure.

**Basic Usage (downloads audio only):**
```bash
python suno_downloader.py --token "your_token_here"
```
This will download all songs into a new folder named `suno-downloads`.

**Full-Featured Usage (with thumbnails and a custom directory):**
```bash
python suno_downloader.py --token "your_token_here" --directory "My Suno Music" --with-thumbnail
```
This will download all songs and their thumbnails into a folder named `My Suno Music`.

### Command-Line Arguments

- `--token` **(Required)**: Your Suno authorization token.
- `--directory` (Optional): The local directory where files will be saved. Defaults to `suno-downloads`.
- `--with-thumbnail` (Optional): A flag to download and embed the song's cover art.
- `--proxy` (Optional): A proxy server URL (e.g., `http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8080`). You can provide multiple proxies separated by commas.
